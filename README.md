A polyglot's sanity helper...!

## Concept

If you are studying multiple languages at the same time, you have languages that
you:

- prioritize
- want to maintain
- (maybe) some you want to be constantly in contact with

## Usage

It was the first script I wrote and actually used. Everything is hardcoded.

The list `languages` contains all the languages.
`base_languages` are those you want to be sure to see everyday.

For each weekday, the script will print the `base_languages` plus another
languages defined... well, take a look and you will see where.

## Roadmap

Yes, there is one. Make it waaay more customizable.
